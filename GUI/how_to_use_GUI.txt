1. Put ADC output file from REDPITAYA sensor in the SAME directory as sensor_project_GUI.mlapp
Note: ADC file must have AT LEAST 2 rows of data, otherwise the app will not read it !

2. Rename it EXACTLY to adc.txt, otherwise the app will not find it !

3. Open sensor_project_GUI.mlapp (Matlab with additional Toolboxes requires)

4. Click on "Import adc.txt" button

5. The left-side plot should show a random echo sample from the adc.txt
Note: Please ignore the warning: "spectrogram.png is missing" by Matlab

6. Next, click on "Gabor transform" button

7. The right-side plot will show the spectrogram, resulting from the random echo sample respectively

8. Now, click on "Export" button
Note: Please do not click or hover your mouse on the Gabor plot, otherwise it will distort the image file "spectrogram.png"

9. Wait until the blue lamp is on, indicating that the image file is sucessfully exported !

10. Finally, click on "Load CNN & predict" button, the prediction will be indicated by a red lamp
Note: Ensure CNNnet.mat is located in the SAME directory as sensor_project_GUI.mlapp
Note: Run the application at first time will cost extra time to fully load the network
